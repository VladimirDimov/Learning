The example shows custom implementation of the controller descriptor instantiation.

This example in fact overrides the whole cycle of selector-typeResolver-assemblyResolver.
Of course the custom controller selector may be implemented which calls the default typeReolver.

Beacause the ControllerDescriptor is cached some logic (like providing controller filters)
is executed only once. This may not be very useful in development mode. This example shows
how to bypass the caching logic. See that the GetFilters() method inside the CustomFilterProvider
is executed on each request when in debug mode. If not in debug mode it is executed only once.
