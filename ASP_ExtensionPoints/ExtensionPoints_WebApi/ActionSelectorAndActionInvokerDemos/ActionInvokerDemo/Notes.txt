1. Demonstrate global exception handling inside Custom Action Invoker.

2. Demostrate how exception filter is hit only on System.Exception-s.
	To do that the action invoker must return Task<HttpResponseMessage> and the exceptions handling part
	of the code must be commented.

3. Why only the system exceptions are caught in the exception filter?
	You can customize how Web API handles exceptions by writing an exception filter. 
	An exception filter is executed when a controller method throws any unhandled exception 
	that is not an HttpResponseException exception. The HttpResponseException type is a special 
	case, because it is designed specifically for returning an HTTP response.
