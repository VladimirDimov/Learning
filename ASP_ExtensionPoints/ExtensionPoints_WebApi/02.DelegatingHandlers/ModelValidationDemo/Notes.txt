1.	Q: Why we add the reponse wraping logic in a delgating handler and not in an action filter?
	A: If an error prior the action execution occur (ex. Authentication failure) the 
	   OnActionExecuted method inside the action filter wont be executed.

3.  Q: Why the ModelState validation logic is inside an ActionFilter?
	A:   Because we don't have a ModelState prior the model binding.
