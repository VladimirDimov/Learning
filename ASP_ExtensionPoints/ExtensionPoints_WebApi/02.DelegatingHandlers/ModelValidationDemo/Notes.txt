1.	Why we add the reponse wraping logic in a delgating handler and not in an action filter?
2.	If an error prior the action execution occur (ex. Authentication failure) the 
	OnActionExecuted method inside the action filter wont be executed.
3. Why the ModelState validation logic is inside an ActionFilter?
	Because we don't have a ModelState prior the model binding.
